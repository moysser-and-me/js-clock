# js-clock
This is the second project from javascript30.com.  I started from the tutorial index.html file that creates a clock with hands that includes the css in a &lt;style> block.  I needed to add the  css transforms and transitions as well as the javascript to convert seconds, minutes, and hours into positions on the clock and have the hands move according to the actual time.
