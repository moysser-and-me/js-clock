# js-clock
This is the second project from javascript30.com.  I started from the tutorial index.html file that creates a clock with hands that includes the css in a &lt;style> block.  I needed to add the css transforms and transitions as well as the javascript to convert seconds, minutes, and hours into positions on the clock and have the hands move according to the actual time.

I watched the video, then worked on the css and javascript I needed to add.  I needed alot of help remembering the syntax, so I checked with the tutorial video as I went along.  When it wasn't working, I also checked with the tutorial video.  I was able to get it working.

My friend Moysser and I deleted the javascript and recreated it from scratch.  We did well, having to only look at the tutorial video to help debug two issues.
